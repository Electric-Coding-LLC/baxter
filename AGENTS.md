# AGENTS.md

Project-specific instructions for Codex agents live here.

## Working Agreement
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Run tests relevant to changed code by default.
- Install or update dependencies when required by implementation; report dependency changes in the summary.
- Ask before running long-running or potentially destructive commands.
- Prefer `rg` for file/content search.
- Keep responses concise and actionable.
- Aim for ~500 lines per file; split when it exceeds unless there’s a good reason.
