# AGENTS.md

Project-specific instructions for Codex agents live here.

## Working Agreement
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Ask before running tests or installing dependencies.
- Prefer `rg` for file/content search.
- Keep responses concise and actionable.
- Aim for ~500 lines per file; split when it exceeds unless there’s a good reason.
